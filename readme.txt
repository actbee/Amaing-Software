Amazing-Software

This is a little project based on the paper A Mixed-Initiative Interface for Animating Static Pictures.
I am still building it right now.
The patchmatch codes use the one contributed by a github user, 03 0 liu1475341362.(https://github.com/liu1475341362/PatchMatch-)
And notice that all pictures in the project should be changed if clone this from github.
Hope I can finish the WHOLE project^~~^
